Define a frontgroup for your Elgg installation. 
Prevents ordinary users, that are not members of any frontgroup, from posting public stuff -
they can only set their read access to 'private', 'loggedin' or 'group:...' but not 'public'.

This plugins lets administrators set groups as "Frontgroup".
Only user which are members of a frontgroup are able to post 
public stuff. For every other user the creation of object with 
access level 'public' is prohibited - thus they can only choose
between 'pivate', 'loggedin' or the groups ('group: [name]').

Please note, that a group has to be OPEN so that guest can see
their public content. If you are concerned about people just joining
this groups you can calm down: Although frontgroups may be 'Open', users
can only join if they got an invitation.
