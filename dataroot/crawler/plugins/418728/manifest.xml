Although this plugin does cover most cases, you will probably want to go 
over the texts and make sure they are to your taste.

I created all the Spotlights needed for my installation, but you may have
extra plugins that create more contexts.  If so it is very easy to add a
new spotlight context.  Just add a 'context'.php file in the views/default/spotlight
directory with code similar to the others, and add your text in the en.php file.
I'm not getting into details, it's just too easy :)

If you do find text that fits better, I would greatly appreciate you uploading your 
language pack to our support group in order to improve this plugin.
