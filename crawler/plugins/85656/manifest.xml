<!--

Based on the default messageboard plugin provided by Elgg 1.5, i modified it a bit to support the entry of anonymous messages. Kinda like a guestbook. Also removed the history links. Added pagination to the 'view all' page.

Plugin is still named the same so it replaces the current install of message board.
Replace the messageboard plugin code with the code in the zip. That should do it.

1.5.2:
