<!--

Although this plugin does cover most cases, you will probably want to go 
over the texts and make sure they are to your taste.

I modified all the Spotlights needed for my installation based on Rise_Spotlight by Rise Software
but you may have extra plugins that create more contexts.  If so it is very easy to add a
new spotlight context.  Just add a "pagename".php file in the views/default/spotlight
directory with code similar to the others, and add your text in the en.php file.

This plugin is meant to work with the updated xpages plugin (not the expages one).

If you'd like to share your spotlight definitions, simply upload your language
file to the Elgg.org plugins area.

Peace, love and magic,
CrazyMofo77
