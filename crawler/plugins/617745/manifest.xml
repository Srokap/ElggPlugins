<!--

Default Elgg persistent login only supports one "remember me" at the time. You can't be remember on more than one browser/computer.

This plugin provides the ability to have yourself remembered on more than one place.

This plugin is build on 1.7.4 but should work from 1.6 up.

Be aware that this is a first (0.1) release and is a bit experimental. It would be appreciated if you could let us know if this plugin works.
